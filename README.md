Title: "Bank Churn Analysis with Power BI"



Description:

I recently completed a data analysis project on bank churn using Power BI. The objective of this project was to gain insights into customer behavior and identify factors that contribute to customer churn.



Key Highlights:



Data Collection: I gathered a comprehensive dataset from  Kaggle to perform this analysis. 

Data Cleaning: I meticulously cleaned and preprocessed the data, ensuring its readiness for analysis.

Data Visualization: I harnessed the power of Power BI to create intuitive and interactive visualizations that provide a clear overview of customer churn trends.

Key Metrics: Without deploying advanced statistical techniques, I focused on basic metrics such as customer counts, churn rates, and customer demographics.

Segmentation Analysis: I explored customer segments and their behavior to identify potential patterns that could contribute to churn.

Customer Feedback Analysis: I also examined customer feedback data (if available) to understand customer sentiment and issues contributing to churn.

Recommendations: Based on the insights gained, I generated preliminary recommendations for the bank to reduce churn.

I hope this project sparks discussions and collaboration in the field of customer churn analysis. Please feel free to reach out for more details and a closer look at the visualizations.# BANK_Churn_Analysis_
